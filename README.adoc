== Style Guide

Use WebKit style to cope with the extremely long names of the Vulkan API. Structs follow the `typedef {} CamelCase` convention for the above reason and for compatibility with flecs.

All identifiers use `camelCase`, while data types use `PascalCase`. What act as a constructor follow `_PascalCase` or `newPascalCase`. Private identifiers start with underscore.

ECS entities start with `spawnEntityName` and end with `cleanupEntityName`.
